## Key Questions Addressed

- How does zero-shot LLM performance compare to a fine-tuned SLM?
- What is the cost break-even point between API usage and fine-tuning?
- How do latency and scalability differ between approaches?
- Which approach is more suitable for startups vs enterprises?

## Business Relevance

This comparison reflects a **real-world decision** faced by companies deploying AI in customer support:

- **LLMs** offer speed and flexibility for early-stage experimentation
- **Fine-tuned SLMs** offer superior economics, control, and latency at scale

The final recommendation is detailed in the accompanying business memo.
